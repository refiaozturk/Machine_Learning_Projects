    "\n",
    "In machine learning, combining multiple models to create a stronger and more generalizable model is a common approach. This technique is known as **ensemble methods**, and one of the most popular among them is **Stacking**.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this notebook, we will thoroughly explore the stacking method and apply it as a classification problem on the **Titanic** dataset.\r\n",

    "**What is Stacking?**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Stacking** is an ensemble method used to improve prediction performance by combining multiple machine learning models. In this technique, multiple models work together to create a more robust and general prediction model.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**The Logic of Stacking:**\r\n",
    "- Different machine learning algorithms may make different predictions on the data.\r\n",
    "- Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses. Stacking aims to leverage the strengths of these models.\r\n",
    "- First, several base models are trained, and their predictions are then used by a **meta model** (upper model).\r\n",
    "- The meta model combines the predictions of the base models to make the final prediction.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Stacking Steps:**\r\n",
    "1. **Base Models:** Various machine learning algorithms are trained in the first layer.\r\n",
    "2. **Meta Model:** In the second layer, a meta model is trained that takes the predictions of the base models as input and makes the final prediction based on them.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Advantages of Stacking:**\r\n",
    "- **Generalization Ability:** Reduces the risk of overfitting that a single model may suffer from.\r\n",
    "- **Performance:** By combining the strengths of different models, stacking can achieve higher accuracy.\r\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Different model types (tree-based models, linear models, etc.) can be used together.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Popular Stacking Applications:**\r\n",
    "- **Kaggle Competitions:** Stacking is especially popular among users competing in Kaggle competitions.\r\n",
    "- **Big Data and Complex Problems:** Stacking is very effective for complex datasets and difficult classifiation/regression problems.\r\n"
