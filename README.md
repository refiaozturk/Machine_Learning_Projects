## 📘 Overview
This repository showcases my journey in Machine Learning through various projects. Each project demonstrates the application of different algorithms and techniques to solve real-world problems. The projects cover a wide range of topics, from supervised and unsupervised learning to deep learning.

## 📊 Projects Included
**📚 00 - Learning ML**: This folder contains the basic notebooks I prepared while learning ML.

**🍃 01 - CO2 Emission Project**: This project analyzes vehicle specifications and fuel consumption data to predict CO2 emissions using exploratory data analysis (EDA), simple linear regression, and multiple linear regression techniques.

**🚗 02 - Auto Scout Project**: This project focuses on predicting car prices using regression techniques such as Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet to analyze data effectively.

**🍇 03 - Raisin Classification Project**: This project focuses on classifying raisin types (Kecimen and Besni) using machine learning techniques. It explores classification models, feature scaling, and evaluation metrics to analyze and distinguish the two classes effectively.

**💸 04 - Income Prediction Project**: This project focuses on predicting income levels (≤50K or >50K) using classification techniques such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to tackle imbalanced data and analyze features effectively.

**✍️ 05 - Handwritten Digit Recognition Project**: This project explores the classification of handwritten digits using SVC, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms, highlighting their comparative performance and accuracy.

**🚢 06 - Titanic Survival Prediction Project**: This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival rates using machine learning models such as XGBoost, GradientBoost, and AdaBoost. Feature engineering, data visualization, and evaluation metrics like F1-score, accuracy, ROC-AUC, and PRC are used to assess model performance.

**🪖 07 - Soldier Race Classification Project**: This project aims to classify soldiers' ethnicities (White, Black, Hispanic) based on anthropometric measurements from the ANSUR II dataset. It explores supervised machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Gradient Boosting. The project also addresses class imbalance using SMOTE and evaluates models for optimal performance.

**🛍️ 08 - Customer Segmentation Project**: This project focuses on segmenting online retail customers using RFM analysis and unsupervised clustering techniques. Customers are categorized into Bronze, Silver, Gold, and VIP segments based on their purchasing behavior. The insights gained from this analysis can help businesses optimize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance personalized promotions.
