## 📘 Overview
This repository showcases my journey in Machine Learning through various projects. Each project demonstrates the application of different algorithms and techniques to solve real-world problems. The projects cover a wide range of topics, from supervised and unsupervised learning to deep learning.

## 📊 Projects Included
**✍️ 00 - Learning ML**: This folder contains the basic notebooks I prepared while learning ML.

**🍃 01 - CO2 Emission Project**: This project analyzes vehicle specifications and fuel consumption data to predict CO2 emissions using exploratory data analysis (EDA), simple linear regression, and multiple linear regression techniques.

**🚗 02 - Auto Scout Project**: This project focuses on predicting car prices using regression techniques such as Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet to analyze data effectively.

**🍇 03 - Raisin Classification Project**: This project focuses on classifying raisin types (Kecimen and Besni) using machine learning techniques. It explores classification models, feature scaling, and evaluation metrics to analyze and distinguish the two classes effectively.

## 🗂️ Structure

1. **Data Preparation and EDA**🧹📂:  
   - Load and explore the datasets.  
   - Perform necessary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand and clean the data.  
   - Prepare the data for Machine Learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling.  

2. **Data Visualization**🔍📊:  
   - Create detailed visualizations to illustrate data patterns, correlations, and insights.
  
3. **Model Training and Testing**⚙️:  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.  
   - Train and test initial Machine Learning models to assess baseline performance.  

4. **Model Building and Prediction**⚙🤖:  
   - Develop multiple Machine Learning models using different algorithms.  
   - Generate predictions from each model and evaluate their performance.  

5. **Performance Comparison**📈🏆:  
   - Compare model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or RMSE (depending on the task).  
   - Visualize and analyze the results to identify the best-performing model.  

6. **Final Model Selection**🎯:  
   - Select the final model based on performance metrics and robustness.  
   - Test the final model with new input data and generate predictions.
